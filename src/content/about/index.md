I'm a software engineer who believes you don't have to quit your job to see the world. While working remotely at NVIDIA, I've figured out how to balance a fulfilling career with a passion for travel.

This blog is my outlet to share what I've learned. The practical stuff like how to buy bus tickets at random stations in Mexico, how much a metro card costs in Istanbul, and exactly how to get from one city to another. The details that actually matter when you're planning a trip.

I'm not here to sell you a dream of becoming a digital nomad or influencer. I'm here for the rest of us: people who love their jobs but also want to explore beyond the office walls.

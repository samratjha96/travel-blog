If you're trying to plan Azerbaijan fast, here's the short answer: base yourself in **Baku's Old City**, walk almost everywhere, and do **one day trip to Gobustan + Yanardag**. I visited in **June 2023** and tracked real prices in manat so you can budget without guesswork.

## Azerbaijan Itinerary Snapshot

- **Trip length:** 3 full days in Baku + day trip
- **Best base:** Old City (Icherisheher)
- **Currency:** Azerbaijani manat (AZN)
- **Getting around:** Walking + Bolt taxis (cash)

## 3-Day Baku Itinerary (With What I Actually Did)

### Day 1: Old City + Baku Seafront

We landed and headed straight into the Old City, which ended up being the perfect base. The streets are tight and maze-like, the walls are still there, and everything feels walkable in the best way. From there we drifted down to the promenade, crossed Fountain Square, and looped by the F1 circuit area as the sun started to drop. It's an easy walking day and a great introduction to Baku.

Highlights from the day:

- **Old City (Icherisheher):** walk the alleys and historic walls
- **Baku Boulevard / Promenade:** flat, scenic, and easy
- **F1 circuit area + Fountain Square:** good people-watching
- **Fire Towers view:** sunset looks great from the boulevard
- **Mini Venice:** short boat ride on the canals
- **Carpet Museum:** surprisingly cool two-floor history of carpets
- **Maiden Tower:** climb to the top for views

**What it cost (June 2023):**

| Item | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Mini Venice boat ride | 3 manat |
| Carpet Museum | 10 manat |
| Maiden Tower | 15 manat |

**Where I ate:**

- **[Salam Baku](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Salam%20Baku%2C%20Kichik%20Qala%20St%20126%2C%20Baku) (breakfast):** ~80 manat for three people
- **[Dolma Restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Dolma%20Restaurant%2C%2053%20Istiglaliyyat%20St%2C%20Baku) (dinner):** ~40 manat for a full meal

## Day 2: Palaces, Food, and Old City Deep Dive

This was the day the Old City really clicked. We finally got into the **Palace of the Shirvanshahs**, which had been closed the day before. It's one of those places you can wander and touch, not just glance at. After that we slowed down, ate well, and spent the evening circling back through the Old City at night.

- **Palace of the Shirvanshahs:** must-do and walkable from Old City
- **Lunch in the city center:** easy to find local cuisine
- **Stroll back through the Old City at night**

**What it cost (June 2023):**

| Item | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Palace of the Shirvanshahs | 15 manat |
| Combo ticket (Palace + Maiden Tower + bath/underground city) | ~34 manat |

**Where I ate:**

- **[Nergiz](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Nergiz%20Restaurant%2C%20Fountain%20Square%2C%209%20Tarlan%20Aliyarbeyov%20St%2C%20Baku) (lunch):** ~60 manat total for two

## Day 3: Gobustan + Yanardag Day Trip

If you want to see more than Baku, this is the easiest and most memorable day. We booked a local tour mostly for transport and did three quick stops: mud volcanoes, Gobustan's rock art, and Yanardag's burning hillside. Gobustan in particular is worth it for the scale and history.

**My tour:** [TES Tours](https://testour.az/tour/day-trip-baku-group-tour) (mostly transportation)

- **Mud volcanoes:** quick stop, cool but short
- **Gobustan National Park:** ancient cave paintings and wide views
- **Yanardag (Burning Mountain):** natural gas fire burning on the hillside

**What it cost (June 2023):**

| Item | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Tour transport | 50 manat per person |
| Gobustan entry | 10 manat |
| Yanardag combo ticket | 15 manat |

## Where to Stay in Baku

**Old City** is the best choice for a first visit. It's the most walkable area, you can step into restaurants or cafes without planning, and the atmosphere at night is hard to beat.

## Getting Around Baku (And the One Tip That Matters)

- **Use Bolt for taxis** and always pick **cash**.
- **Withdraw manat** early. ATMs can be finicky, and it's easier for everything.

I had ATM problems and ended up going to **Pasha Bank**, which worked without issues.

## Azerbaijan Travel Costs: Quick Budget Reality

Here is the quick budget reality based on my trip.

| Category | Typical Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Attractions (per major site) | 10-15 manat |
| Nice sit-down meal | 20-30 manat per person |
| Taxi across town (Bolt) | Very cheap (pay cash) |
| Day trip (tour + entry fees) | 75-85 manat per person |

If you're traveling mid-range, **Baku feels affordable**. Most of your spend is food and entry fees, not transport.

## What I'd Do Again (And What I'd Skip)

**Do again:**

- Palace of the Shirvanshahs
- Gobustan + Yanardag day trip
- Walking Old City at night
- Dinner at Dolma

**Could skip:**

- Mini Venice (cute but short)

## FAQ: Azerbaijan Itinerary Planning

**Is 3 days in Baku enough?**
Yes. You can see the Old City, major sites, and do a day trip without rushing.

**Do you need a tour for Gobustan?**
Not required, but it's the simplest way to see Gobustan + Yanardag in one day without renting a car.

**Is Baku walkable?**
Very. If you stay in Old City, most of the main sights are on foot.

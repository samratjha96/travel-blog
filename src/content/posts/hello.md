Welcome to my not-so-secret society of everyday adventurers. If you've ever found yourself daydreaming about trading your desk chair for a beach lounger without giving your boss a piece of your mind, you're in the right place. This is Techbro Travels, where I believe in chasing sunsets, not unemployment checks.

I'm not here to sell you the dream of quitting your job to sip coconut water in Bali while pretending to be an influencer. Nah dawg! I'm here for the rest of us - the ones who love (well or at least don't despise) their jobs but also dream of exploring the world beyond the water cooler.

## The Desk Jockey Diaries Begin

Picture this: You, comfortably seated at your desk, daydreaming of destinations far and wide. Instead of updating your LinkedIn profile to "Digital Nomad Guru," how about we just plan the trip. Get our PTO in order, take the trip of a lifetime and then do it over and over again. All the while continuing to collect and enjoy our paychecks. You don't need to quit your job, shill some BS coaching course or sleep in 16 people dorms because you are too broke to afford anything better ðŸ˜¬

My philosophy is simple: extraordinary travels with ordinary lives. I'm not here to convince you to quit your job; I'm here to uncover the hidden gems of the world while still enjoying the comfort of a paycheck. So, put down that resignation letter and pick up your passport, I'll show you how to be a normal person with a job and still see the world. Not all of us want to sell our souls for a one way ticket to influencer stardom.

## The Anti-Influencer Brigade

Speaking of which let's talk about those travel bloggers who think a beach photo and a vague caption about "living their best life" is groundbreaking content. I'm part of the anti-influencer brigade, the rebels against recycled sunset pictures with motivational quotes. I'm here to bring substance, humor, and genuine experiences to your feed. I travel the world, while being a software engineer working 40 (boss wishes it was 60) hours a week. I say that to convey I'm but a regular guy who has a dream to see the world. I want to use this blog to simply talk about my experiences, give helpful tips and ultimately help you plan and execute your dream trip

## Travel blogs are a cesspool ðŸ¤¢

I am not a SEO shill, not an AI content generator and not in the search of a quick buck. I'm sick and tired of ending up on blogs that just shill products/promotions/sponsorships. Can a man please just get some actual, informational content while planning my trip! I want this blog to be essentially my ramblings about the trips I go on but geared towards actually being informational. I have been writing little details about my trips over the last few years - things like how to buy bus tickets at random bus station in Mexico, how much a metro card costs in Istanbul and exactly how to get from one city to another. I often find these details to be what I'm really looking for when planning some of my trips. I'll share all the tips/tricks I have learned, my packing list, my pre-trip checklist, my guide to places and a bunch of other amazing resources I have been piling up over the years. Techbro travels will be a place for me to share all of that with you, my dear reader(s).

So get in, loser. We are going on a trip!

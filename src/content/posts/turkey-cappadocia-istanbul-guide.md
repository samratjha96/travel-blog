faqs:
  - question: "How much does a hot air balloon ride cost in Cappadocia?"
    answer: "Expect to pay 200 to 250 euros per person with a reputable company. Book directly with the balloon company rather than through a middleman tour agency."
  - question: "Is the Green Tour or Red Tour better in Cappadocia?"
    answer: "Both are worth doing if you have time. The Green Tour covers underground cities and the Ihlara Valley hike. The Red Tour covers the fairy chimneys and the Open Air Museum. If you can only pick one, the Green Tour is more distinctive."
  - question: "How do I get around Istanbul?"
    answer: "The IstanbulKart works on all public transit including tram and metro. One card works for multiple people. Top it up at any metro station. The transit system covers most tourist areas."
  - question: "Is Kadikoy worth visiting in Istanbul?"
    answer: "If you have 3 or more days in Istanbul, yes. With only 2 days, prioritize Topkapi Palace, the Grand Bazaar, and the Princes Islands instead."
  - question: "How do I get from Cappadocia to Istanbul?"
    answer: "Fly. It is a 10-plus hour drive otherwise. Flights take about an hour and are cheap. You will fly from either Nevsehir or Kayseri airport near Goreme. Arrange the transfer through your hotel."
  - question: "How much should I budget per day in Turkey?"
    answer: "For a mid-range trip, budget around $100 to $150 per day for two people. That covers a decent hotel, tours, meals at sit-down restaurants, and attractions."

    answer: "No, not compared to Western Europe. Meals are $10 to $25 for two, transit is cheap, and even major attractions like Topkapi Palace are under $20. The main splurge is the hot air balloon."
  - question: "Should I use cash or card in Turkey?"
    answer: "Both work. Cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops in tourist areas. You will need cash for smaller vendors, the Grand Bazaar, and some transit. Avoid exchanging money at the airport as the rates are poor."

5 days, 2 cities, and all the numbers you actually need. I'm not going to tell you Turkey changed my life. Instead, I'm going to tell you what I did, what I paid, and what's actually worth your time.

**Note:** This trip was in June 2023. Prices may have shifted, but the logistics and tips should still hold up.

## Table of contents

## The Quick Numbers

Before we get into it, here's what you're looking at cost-wise:

| Item                             | Cost                   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Hot air balloon (2 people)       | €480 (~$520)           |
| Daily tours in Cappadocia        | $50-60/person          |
| IstanbulKart (metro card)        | 50 lira (~$2.50)       |
| Average dinner for two           | $12-25                 |
| Göreme airport transfer          | 260 lira/person (~$14) |
| Topkapı Palace (combined ticket) | 650 lira/person        |

### Total Trip Cost (2 People, 5 Days)

If you're wondering what this trip actually cost, here's the rough breakdown for two people:

- **Flights (US to Istanbul, Istanbul to Cappadocia):** ~$800-1000
- **Accommodation (5 nights):** ~$300-400
- **Hot air balloon:** €480 (~$520)
- **Tours (ATV, Green, Red, walking tour, cruise, pub crawl):** ~$250
- **Food and drinks:** ~$200
- **Attractions and entrance fees:** ~$100
- **Transport (IstanbulKart, ferries, airport transfers):** ~$60

**Grand total: roughly $2,200-2,500 for two people**, not including international flights. Solo travelers can cut some of that since the balloon and accommodation split differently.

## Cappadocia (Days 1-3)

### Day 1: Arrive + Sunset ATV Tour

I stayed at **Caravanserai Inn** in Göreme. Central location, comfortable rooms, and free breakfast. Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done and you're steps away from everything.

The move on day one is to book a [sunset ATV tour](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/4037378). I found mine through Airbnb Experiences for $32/person, and it was two hours of riding through Swords Valley, Red Valley, Rose Valley, and Love Valley. The landscapes are absolutely ridiculous. You've seen the photos online, but trust me, they don't do it justice. The tour includes hotel pickup and dropoff, so you don't have to worry about logistics.

For dinner, we hit **Göreme Han Restaurant**. About $25 for two people with solid Turkish food. Nothing revolutionary, but good portions and a nice atmosphere after a dusty ATV ride.

### Day 2: Hot Air Balloon + Green Tour

**4:40am pickup.** Yes, it sucks. No, you can't skip it if you want to catch the sunrise.

The hot air balloon is the thing everyone comes to Cappadocia for, and honestly, it lives up to the hype. I went with Brother Balloons and paid €480 for two people (roughly $260/person). My advice: book directly with a reputable company rather than through random tour agencies that'll upcharge you for the same experience.

After landing, you'll have time to crash for a bit before the **Green Tour** pickup at 9:30am. I booked through Viator, but the actual operator was Hereke Travel. They're solid and I ended up using them again.

The Green Tour covers:

- Göreme Panorama viewpoint
- Pigeon Valley
- Kaymakli Underground City (this is wild, we're talking an entire city carved underground)
- Selime Monastery
- Ihlara Valley, a 3km hike through a canyon dotted with rock-cut churches

For dinner, we tried **CanCan Restaurant**, and here's a pro tip: only order one main dish. They bury you in free appetizers like bread, dips, and salads. We made the mistake of over-ordering and couldn't finish half of it.

### Day 3: Red Tour + Transfer to Istanbul

Back with Hereke Travel for the **Red Tour**, pickup again at 9:30am.

The Red Tour hits:

- Uçhisar Castle
- Love Valley
- Göreme Open Air Museum (a UNESCO site with rock-cut churches and frescoes)
- Avanos pottery demonstration
- Devrent Valley (aka Imagination Valley, where rocks look like camels, seals, you name it)
- Paşabağ fairy chimneys

One thing worth paying for: the extra 100 lira to see the Dark Church inside the Open Air Museum. The frescoes are incredibly well-preserved, and since most tourists skip it, you actually get some breathing room inside.

For our last dinner in Cappadocia, we tried a Turkish ravioli (mantı) place. Tasty, but heads up: no non-beef options if that matters to you. We grabbed coffee at Viewpoint Restaurant and Cafe afterward for one last look at the landscape.

We arranged our airport transfer through the hotel with Göreme Transfers. 260 lira per person for a smooth ride to the airport, then flew to Istanbul.

## Istanbul (Days 4-6)

### Day 4: Old City + Bosphorus Cruise

First order of business: **get yourself an IstanbulKart**. It's 50 lira at any metro station and works on trams, metro, ferries, and buses. Basically everything. One card can be used for multiple people (just tap it multiple times), and topping up at any station takes seconds. Also, download the **Yandex Metro app**. It'll save you from staring at confusing transit maps.

I joined a [walking tour through Airbnb Experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/2167606) that hit all the essentials:

- Hippodrome
- Basilica Cistern (an extra 350 lira per person, but worth it if you're into history. The atmosphere down there is unreal)

![Basilica Cistern](/images/posts/turkey/Sistern.jpg)

- Grand Bazaar (more on this later)
- Hagia Sophia
- Blue Mosque

![Inside Hagia Sophia](/images/posts/turkey/IMG_2742.jpg)

![Hagia Sophia interior](/images/posts/turkey/IMG_2795.jpg)

**A note on the mosques:** there's a dress code. Shoulders and knees need to be covered, and women need head coverings. Men, wear pants or at least shorts that cover the knees. If you forget, they sell scarves and coverups right outside, but you'll pay tourist prices. Better to bring your own.

For lunch, I grabbed a lamb pide (basically Turkish flatbread pizza) at some restaurant I can't remember the name of, but it was fantastic. Honestly, pide is a safe bet pretty much anywhere in Istanbul.

That evening, I did a [Bosphorus sunset cruise](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1590116) booked through Airbnb, and this ended up being one of the highlights of the trip. You meet at the pier, cruise around the strait for a couple hours, and they provide free drinks and finger food. The views are unreal. Watching the sun set over the Istanbul skyline from the water, with mosques and minarets silhouetted against the sky, is something else entirely. It's a nice, low-effort way to end a long day of walking, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

### Day 5: Asian Side + Grand Bazaar + Nightlife

In the morning, I took the ferry to Kadıköy (the Asian side of Istanbul) from Karaköy pier. 19 lira per person for about a 40-minute ride. Walked around the neighborhood, found a Friends-themed cafe with great Shalep (a hot Turkish drink worth trying), and wandered over to Moda Sahili park.

**My honest take:** Kadıköy is fine, but it's not essential. If you're tight on time, skip it and spend more time in the Old City. The fish sandwich at the fish market was mid at best.

The afternoon was all about **Grand Bazaar shopping**. One important note: **it's closed on Sundays**, so plan accordingly.

Here's what I paid:

- Turkish delight: 500 lira per kg
- Baklava: 570 lira per half kg
- Random trinkets: haggle hard, start at 50% of the asking price and work from there

The bazaar is absolutely massive and you will get lost. That's fine. Just embrace it and wander. You'll stumble into interesting corners you wouldn't have found otherwise.

![Grand Bazaar](/images/posts/turkey/Bazaar.jpg)

I also popped into **St. Anthony of Padua Basilica** nearby, which is worth a quick visit if you're into architecture.

For nightlife, I did the [party bus tour](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/3706544) (also marketed as the Istanbul Pub Crawl on Airbnb). It starts at a bar in Sultanahmet with drinking games, then a party bus shuttles you to clubs in Taksim Square. You get one free shot at each club; other drinks are on you. Free entry everywhere, well organized, and I met some cool people. Solid option if you want to go out but don't know where to start.

### Day 6: Topkapı Palace + Princes' Islands

Started the morning at **Topkapı Palace**. The combined ticket including the Harem runs 650 lira per person.

**Pro tip:** Get there by 10:30am and you won't need a "skip the line" ticket. The crowds build up later in the day.

What to prioritize inside:

- The Holy Relics section in Courtyard 3 (yes, really. It's more interesting than it sounds)
- The Harem (save this for last since it's a separate section)
- The views of the Bosphorus from the terraces

In the afternoon, I took the ferry from Kabataş to the Princes' Islands.

**Learn from my mistake:** Look up ferry times BEFORE you go. We showed up at Eminönü first only to discover there was no Sunday ferry, then waited an extra hour at Kabataş because we hadn't checked the schedule. Don't be us.

I went to **Büyükada**, the largest of the islands. No cars are allowed, so you get around by bike or on foot.

![Princes' Islands](/images/posts/turkey/IMG_3270.jpg)

- Bike rental runs about 50 lira per person per hour
- Fair warning: the island loop isn't easy. Expect hills and unpaved sections, so prepare to work for it
- Dilburnu Park has a 21 lira entrance fee but it's a great spot to rest and grab some photos
- There's a monastery at the top of an incline hill. The climb is worth it for the rooftop terrace restaurant with incredible views

**Another tip:** If you arrive early enough, grab an all-day pass at one of the beach clubs. Umbrella, drinks, wifi, the whole package for about 350 lira per person. We got there too late and missed out.

I caught the 8:35pm ferry back to Kabataş. Heads up: the return trip takes about 2 hours since it stops at all the islands along the way.

For a late dinner, **Karadeniz Pide Salonu** is open 24 hours. More pide. Zero regrets.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does a hot air balloon ride cost in Cappadocia?

Expect to pay €200-250 per person with a reputable company. I used Brother Balloons and had a great experience. Book directly with the balloon company rather than through a middleman tour agency.

### Is the Green Tour or Red Tour better in Cappadocia?

Honestly, both are worth doing if you have time. The Green Tour has the underground cities and the Ihlara Valley hike, making it more adventure-focused. The Red Tour covers the fairy chimneys and the Open Air Museum, making it more sightseeing-oriented. If you can only pick one, I'd lean toward Green, but ideally do both.

### How do I get around Istanbul?

IstanbulKart is your best friend. 50 lira gets you a card that works on all public transit, and one card works for multiple people. Top it up at any metro station. The tram and metro system is genuinely solid and covers most tourist areas.

### Is Kadıköy worth visiting?

If you have 3+ days in Istanbul, sure, it's a nice change of pace. But if you only have 2 days, skip it and prioritize Topkapı Palace, the Grand Bazaar, and the Princes' Islands instead.

### Should I do the Istanbul pub crawl?

If you want to party and meet other travelers, absolutely. It's well organized, you get free club entry, and there's usually a good mix of people. If drinking games and club music aren't your thing, skip it.

### What should I know about dress codes at mosques?

Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque both require covered shoulders and knees. Women need head coverings, and men should wear pants or at least shorts that cover the knees. They sell scarves and coverups outside if you forget, but prices are inflated. Bring your own if you can.

### How do I get from Cappadocia to Istanbul?

Fly. Seriously. It's a 10+ hour drive or bus ride otherwise. Flights are cheap and take about an hour. You'll fly out of either Nevşehir or Kayseri airport near Göreme. Arrange the transfer through your hotel.

### How much should I budget per day in Turkey?

For a mid-range trip like mine, budget around $100-150 per day for two people. That covers a decent hotel, tours, meals at sit-down restaurants, and attractions. You can do it cheaper if you stay in hostels and eat street food, or spend more if you want luxury cave hotels.

### Is Turkey expensive for tourists?

Not compared to Western Europe. Meals are $10-25 for two, transit is dirt cheap, and even "expensive" attractions like Topkapı Palace are under $20. The main splurge is the hot air balloon, but even that is cheaper than similar experiences elsewhere.

### Is the Cappadocia hot air balloon worth it?

Yes. It's expensive at €200-250 per person, but floating over those fairy chimneys at sunrise is genuinely one of the most surreal experiences I've had traveling. If you can afford it, do it. Just book directly with a reputable company.

### How much does food cost in Turkey?

A pide (Turkish flatbread pizza) runs about $5-8. A full dinner for two at a decent restaurant is $20-30. Street food like simit (sesame bread) or dürüm (wraps) cost $2-4. Turkish breakfast spreads at cafes are around $8-12 per person and will keep you full until dinner.

### Should I use cash or card in Turkey?

Both work. Cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops in tourist areas. You'll need cash for smaller vendors, the Grand Bazaar (easier to haggle), and some transit. ATMs are everywhere. Just avoid exchanging money at the airport since the rates are terrible.

## Final Thoughts

Turkey punches way above its weight. You get ancient history, landscapes that look like another planet, and legitimately excellent food, all without Western Europe prices. Five days is tight but absolutely doable if you don't waste time agonizing over where to eat lunch.

The hot air balloon is expensive but worth every cent. The underground cities are way cooler than you'd expect. Istanbul's public transit puts most American cities to shame. And Turkish breakfast spreads? Borderline religious experience.

Book it.

faqs:
  - question: "Is a digital nomad visa worth it?"
    answer: "If you qualify and plan to stay more than a few months, yes. Legal residence is better than tourist visa overstays. Run the tax numbers before you apply."
  - question: "What happens if I work remotely on a tourist visa?"
    answer: "It is technically illegal in most countries. Enforcement varies. Indonesia has deported people for it. Whether it happens to you is a risk calculation, not a guarantee either way."
  - question: "Do digital nomad visas make you a tax resident?"
    answer: "The visa itself does not, but your physical presence does. 183 days in most countries triggers tax residency. Consult a tax professional in your home country and the destination country before you stay past six months anywhere."
  - question: "Which is the easiest digital nomad visa to get?"
    answer: "Thailand's DTV has the lowest bureaucratic friction for people with the savings to qualify. Portugal and Spain involve more paperwork and longer processing. Portugal's D8 is well-established with over 2,600 visas issued as of 2024."
  - question: "Can freelancers use Spain's Beckham Law?"
    answer: "No. The Beckham Law flat 24% tax rate applies only to employed workers under an employment contract. Self-employed and freelance workers do not qualify."
  - question: "Is the Bali digital nomad visa actually $60,000 per year?"
    answer: "Yes. The E33G requires a minimum annual income of $60,000 from a foreign source. Most Bali nomad content does not mention this because it targets a different income bracket."

There are two kinds of digital nomad visa content. The first kind is written by immigration lawyers and consultants who want you to hire them. The second kind is written by influencers who want you to follow them. Neither has much incentive to tell you the part where it gets complicated.

Here's what the numbers actually look like.

## Table of contents

## The Income Requirement Nobody Puts in the Headline

The fantasy version of a digital nomad visa: earn $1,500/month from your laptop, apply online, move to Bali. The actual version: most of these visas require you to earn more than the median full-time salary in the country you're applying from.

| Country | Monthly Income Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Portugal (D8) | €3,480/month | Plus €9,840–€11,040 in savings |
| Spain | €2,762/month | €3,797 if bringing a partner; add €346 per child |
| Bali / Indonesia (E33G) | $5,000/month ($60,000/year) | Must be income from a foreign employer |
| Thailand (DTV) | ~$14,500–$17,000 in savings | Or proof of regular foreign income |

Portugal's €3,480 is four times the Portuguese minimum wage. Spain's threshold is pegged to 200% of the national minimum wage and adjusts as wages rise. Bali's $60,000/year requirement is the one that never makes it into the headline pieces, because those pieces are targeting the $1,500/month crowd.

The Thailand DTV, launched in July 2024, doesn't set an income floor in the same way but requires you to show $14,500–$17,000 sitting in a bank account, maintained for at least three months before applying. If your savings aren't that liquid, you don't qualify.

## The Tax Trap

A digital nomad visa is an immigration document. It is not a tax document. Most of the content you'll find about nomad visas glosses over this entirely.

In most countries, spending 183 or more days in a calendar year makes you a tax resident. Tax residency means the country can tax your worldwide income, regardless of where you earned it or where your employer is based. You could be a remote developer working entirely for a US company, never setting foot in a Spanish office, and after 183 days in Barcelona you owe Spanish income tax on every euro you made.

Spain's top marginal rate is 47%. Portugal's runs from 12.5% to 48%. Neither of these numbers appears in the average "move to Europe on a nomad visa" Instagram post.

It gets more complicated. The 183-day threshold isn't the only trigger. Most countries also apply a "center of vital interests" test: if you have a home, a partner, children, or significant clients in a country, authorities can deem you a tax resident even if you're under 183 days. This is rarely explained in nomad visa explainers because it's hard to make into a clean listicle.

**Spain's Beckham Law** gets cited constantly as the solution: a flat 24% income tax rate for people who move to Spain. What the summaries leave out: it only applies to people moving as employees under an employment contract. Freelancers and the self-employed don't qualify. A significant portion of digital nomads are freelancers.

## Country by Country

### Portugal

The D8 visa gets you a temporary entry document valid for four months while your full residence permit is processed. The residence permit itself is valid for two years, then renewable for three-year periods.

The income requirement is €3,480/month, and you need to actually live in Portugal for at least six consecutive months (or eight non-consecutive) per year to maintain it. You can't collect the visa and then disappear.

Portugal's non-habitual resident (NHR) tax regime has been a major selling point for years. The original version offered a flat tax rate and significant exemptions on foreign income for ten years. The regime was restructured in 2024 and the terms have changed. If your research relies on anything published before 2024, check whether the NHR details still apply, because a lot of them don't.

### Spain

Spain's requirement is tied to twice the national minimum wage, which adjusts. At the time of writing that's approximately €2,762/month for a single applicant. Processing at a consulate takes about 20 business days if you apply from abroad.

If you apply from within Spain, you can get a three-year permit directly. If you apply at a consulate, you get an initial one-year visa and convert it later. The difference matters for planning.

183 days triggers full Spanish tax residency and with it, an obligation to declare worldwide assets over €50,000 via the Modelo 720 form. Failing to file it correctly carries significant penalties. This is not mentioned in nomad visa marketing.

### Thailand

The Digital Nomad Visa (DTV) launched in July 2024. It's a five-year, multiple-entry visa. Each entry allows 180 days, extendable to 360 days per year.

The savings requirement: 500,000 Thai baht (roughly $14,500–$17,000 USD depending on exchange rate), held in your bank account for at least three months. You'll also need documentation of remote employment, pay stubs, invoices, or bank deposit records going back six months.

You cannot work for Thai companies or clients on this visa. Remote work must be for employers or clients based outside Thailand.

Thailand doesn't have a simple 183-day income tax rule in the same way European countries do, but the situation is not clean. Tax advice for Thailand is complicated and depends on whether you remit income to a Thai bank account and in which tax year. Get specific advice for your situation.

### Bali (Indonesia)

The E33G remote worker visa requires a minimum annual income of $60,000 from a foreign employer or client. It gives you up to one year of legal residence including a proper KITAS (residence permit). You cannot work for Indonesian companies or earn from Indonesian sources.

That $60,000 floor eliminates most of the audience that Bali nomad content is aimed at. A significant number of people working from Bali are doing so on tourist visas. Tourist visas don't authorize work. Working on a tourist visa is illegal in Indonesia. This is not a technicality; it has led to deportations.

## Who These Visas Actually Work For

People with stable, documented income well above the thresholds and a clean employment contract rather than a portfolio of freelance clients. They get something real: legal residence, no overstay anxiety, the ability to open a bank account, a clear answer if anyone asks why they're there. For them, the paperwork is worth it.

The problem is that this isn't who the content is aimed at. Nomad visa explainers target the person earning $2,000/month on Upwork, eyeing a $600/month apartment in Bali, who just wants a visa that makes it official. That person doesn't qualify for any of the visas in the table above. They're the audience for the content. They're not the audience for the visas.

Portugal and Spain want €2,700–€3,500/month in documented income. Bali wants $60k/year from a foreign employer. Thailand is the most accessible: $14,500 in savings, five-year validity, no annual renewal — but that $14,500 has to actually be sitting in your account for three months before you apply.

Most content ranking for these searches exists to generate consulting inquiries. It is built to make you feel almost qualified. The income requirements are where you find out whether you are.

Georgia doesn't have a nomad visa and doesn't need one. Most Western passport holders enter visa-free and can stay a full year without applying for anything. No income check, no application fee, no accountant required. For the person who wanted the Bali dream on a Bali budget, [Tbilisi](/blog/tbilisi-georgia-budget-guide-costs/) is a more honest answer than most of what ranks on page one.

## FAQ

Tbilisi just hit #2 on Tripadvisor's most trending destinations for 2026. The city is cheap, the food is excellent, the wine costs almost nothing, and the old town looks like nothing else in the region.

Here's what it actually costs and what's worth your time.

## The Short Answer on Cost

**Budget traveler:** $30–45/day
**Mid-range traveler:** $65–90/day

That includes accommodation, food, transport, and a glass of wine at dinner. Skipping the wine in Georgia would be a crime.

## Getting There

Tbilisi has direct flights from most major European cities: Warsaw, Vienna, Amsterdam, Paris, plus connections from the Middle East and Central Asia. Flights from Western Europe typically run $100–200 return if you book a few weeks out.

**From Istanbul:** Short hop, good prices. Flights run $68–125 one-way with AJet and Turkish Airlines. April and February are cheapest.

**From neighboring countries overland:** If you're coming from Armenia or Azerbaijan, marshrutkas (shared minibuses) are cheap, frequent, and the practical choice, though the border crossing adds time. From Baku the bus runs $10–15 and takes 9–11 hours.

**From the airport into the city:** Two options.

| Option | Cost | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Bus 337 (to Freedom Square) | 1 GEL ($0.37) | ~50 min |
| Bolt/Yandex taxi | 25–35 GEL ($9–13) | ~30–40 min |

Do not negotiate with the unmetered street taxis outside arrivals. They quote 80–150 GEL for the same ride Bolt does for 30.

**Currency note:** 1 Georgian lari (GEL) is about $0.37. Pick up a Metromoney card for 2 GEL on arrival; you'll need it for the metro and buses.

## Where to Stay

Stay in Old Tbilisi (Abanotubani and Kala districts). You're walking distance from the sulphur baths, Narikala, the cable car, and the best wine bars. Accommodation here is cheap.

| Type | Price per night |
|---|---|
| Hostel dorm bed | $8–15 |
| Guesthouse private room | $30–45 |
| Airbnb apartment | $65–100 |
| 3-star hotel | $55–75 |

The guesthouse private room is the best value. For $35–40 you often get something with a courtyard and a host who'll point you toward the correct khinkali spot.

## Food Costs: What You'll Actually Spend

Georgian food is cheap by any European standard and very good. The two dishes you'll eat constantly are **khinkali** (dumplings) and **khachapuri** (cheese bread). Both are inexpensive everywhere; both are worth eating well.

**Khinkali** (Georgian dumplings filled with spiced meat or cheese)
- Neighborhood local place: 0.8–1.5 GEL each ($0.30–$0.55)
- Central tourist area: 2–2.50 GEL each ($0.75–$0.90)
- Standard order: 5–10 pieces per person

**Quick meal budgets:**
| Meal type | Cost |
|---|---|
| Khachapuri from a bakery | $1–2 |
| Budget lunch (local canteen) | $4–7 |
| Sit-down dinner for two (with wine) | $22–35 |
| High-end restaurant for two | $55–75 |

Shardeni Street looks beautiful and charges accordingly. Eat one meal there for the atmosphere, then find a neighborhood dukani for everything else. The food is the same. The price is not.

## The Wine Situation

Georgia is one of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world (8,000 years of winemaking). The wine is very good and costs almost nothing.

| Where | What | Price |
|---|---|---|
| Supermarket (Carrefour, Goodwill) | Decent bottle of Saperavi | 25–50 GEL ($9–18) |
| Neighborhood wine bar | Glass of house wine | 6–12 GEL ($2–4.50) |
| Upscale wine bar | Glass | 10–20 GEL ($3.60–7) |

The amber wines (skin-contact whites made in traditional clay qvevri vessels) are the regional speciality. If you've never had one, Tbilisi is the place. Ask for Rkatsiteli or Tsolikouri. Even the cheap pours are worth trying.

The wine bars on Rustaveli Avenue charge 30–50% more for the same pours. Skip them.

## Getting Around the City

The metro covers most places you'll want to go and costs 1 GEL per ride. For everything else, use Bolt. Cheap, reliable, no haggling with street taxis.

| Transport | Cost |
|---|---|
| Metro (per ride) | 1 GEL ($0.37) |
| Cable car (Rike Park to Narikala) | 2.50 GEL ($0.90) |
| Funicular (to Mtatsminda) | 2.50 GEL ($0.90) |
| Bolt taxi (typical city ride) | 7–15 GEL ($2.50–$5.50) |

## A 3-Day Tbilisi Itinerary

### Day 1: Old Town + Sulphur Baths

Walk Old Tbilisi (Kala district) in the morning. The carved wooden balconies, the winding streets, the general dilapidation. The crumbling bits are part of the point.

Afternoon: **Abanotubani** (the sulphur bath district). The natural hot springs here have been running since the 5th century. Go for a private room rather than the shared public baths. Prices have risen, so check which bathhouse fits your budget before you show up.

The budget option is **Bathhouse No. 5** (one of the oldest, since the 1920s): private rooms run 70–110 GEL/hour, public shared bath for 6–10 GEL. If you want something nicer, **Gulo's Thermal Spa** runs 150–300 GEL/hour. The famous **Chreli-Abano** (the one with the mosaic facade) is the luxury end at 130–200+ GEL/hour. Worth it for the architecture alone, but book ahead.

Evening: walk the **Bridge of Peace** at sunset. Free, ten minutes, good view back over Old Town.

**Day 1 costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Sulphur bath (shared public) | 6–10 GEL per person |
| Sulphur bath private room, budget (No. 5) | 70–110 GEL/hour for the room |
| Sulphur bath private room, mid-range (Gulo's) | 150–300 GEL/hour for the room |
| Dinner + wine at a local dukani | 25–35 GEL per person |
| Transport | 5–8 GEL |

### Day 2: Narikala + Mtatsminda + Dry Bridge Market

Take the **cable car up to Narikala Fortress** for the views over the city (2.50 GEL each way). The fortress is free to walk through. The **Mother of Georgia statue** is a short uphill walk from there and worth doing once for the vantage point.

Come back down, grab khinkali somewhere cheap for lunch, then head to the **Dry Bridge Flea Market** (open daily, best on weekends). It's a great sprawl of Soviet memorabilia, art, and antiques. Budget some money if you want to buy anything; budget your time if you want to look at everything.

Evening: take the **funicular up to Mtatsminda Park**. The amusement park at the top is tired, but the view of Tbilisi at night is the best you'll get.

**Day 2 costs:**
| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Cable car (return) | 5 GEL |
| Funicular (return) | 5 GEL |
| Khinkali lunch (8 pieces) | 8–12 GEL |
| Dry Bridge Market (if you buy anything) | variable |

### Day 3: Sameba Cathedral + Wine + Wandering

**Sameba Cathedral** (Holy Trinity Cathedral) is the largest Orthodox church in the Caucasus. Free entry and worth seeing just for the scale.

From there, spend the afternoon at a proper **wine bar**, somewhere like Vino Underground or Wine Factory No. 1, and work through a few glasses of amber wine. Order the qvevri Rkatsiteli if it's on. That's what you came for.

Dinner somewhere in Old Town. Get a terrace if the weather holds.

## What I'd Do Again (And What I'd Skip)

**Do again:**
- Sulphur bath private room (the public ones are fine but the private room is worth splitting)
- Cable car up to Narikala (the walk back down through Old Town is the best part)
- Amber wine at a neighborhood wine bar, not a tourist-facing one
- Dry Bridge Market on a weekend

**Could skip:**
- Mtatsminda Park itself (the funicular ride is the point; the amusement park is tired)
- Any restaurant on Shardeni Street (they're fine, but you're paying for the street)

## Visa

Most Western passport holders (USA, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, and many more) enter Georgia visa-free for up to one year. EU citizens can use a national ID card rather than a passport. China gets 30 days, Iran gets 45 days.

Check the current list at evisa.gov.ge before you travel. Georgia's visa policy has expanded a lot in recent years but it does change. If your country requires one, the e-visa costs approximately $23–65 and processes online within about five business days.

## Best Time to Go

**Go in:** May, June, September, October. May is ideal: 20–25°C, no crowds yet, everything open. Late September–October coincides with the **Rtveli harvest festival**, when winemakers across the country bring in grapes and open their doors. Worth timing a trip around if you can.

**Avoid:** July and August. The city gets up to 35–40°C. Hot, humid, expensive, and crowded.

## The Main Scam to Know About

The bar hustle. A friendly local (often attractive, always persuasive) invites you into a bar you've never heard of. You have a few drinks. The bill arrives itemized with things you didn't order and numbers that don't add up. It still happens, mostly near Rustaveli Avenue and in Old Town after dark.

Rule: if a stranger invites you to a venue that doesn't appear on Google Maps, don't go. Verify the place exists before you walk in.

Street taxis at the airport: already covered above. Use Bolt.

## FAQ: Tbilisi Basics

**Is Tbilisi actually cheap?**
Yes. A full dinner with wine and starters costs what a single main course runs in Western Europe.

**Is it safe?**
Generally yes. Violent crime against tourists is uncommon. The bar scam is the main tourist-targeting issue. Pickpocketing happens on the metro and at the Dry Bridge Market but isn't rampant. One real thing to watch: Georgian drivers don't yield to pedestrians.

**Is English spoken?**
Younger Georgians and anyone in the hospitality industry: yes. Older locals: usually not. You'll get by fine either way.

**Do you need cash?**
Mostly, yes. Card acceptance is improving but inconsistent outside hotels and larger restaurants. Withdraw GEL from ATMs inside bank branches rather than standalone street machines.

**Is 3 days in Tbilisi enough?**
Enough to see the main things and eat well. Four days lets you do a day trip. Mtskheta (the ancient capital, 30 minutes away) is the easy option.

**Can you combine it with other countries in the region?**
Georgia sits between Armenia and Azerbaijan; overland crossings are easy. If you're also doing [Baku](/blog/azerbaijan-baku-3-day-itinerary-costs/), the marshrutka between the two cities costs $10–15 and runs overnight.
